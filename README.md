# night-light

This is an F# program that turns all the lights in our apartment

* _red_ at 8.30pm in the evening, and
* _white_/_yellow_ (depending on the room) at 4.45am in the morning.

`NightLight.Core` is the functional core, and `NightLight` is the imperative shell.

Runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
